### Step 2: Configure Contract Roles

#### 2.1 Update Environment Variables

Create `.env.mainnet` file with your Safe addresses:

```bash
# Multi-Signature Wallet Addresses
ADMIN_MULTISIG=0x... # Your Admin Safe address
OPERATOR_MULTISIG=0x... # Your Operator Safe address
EMERGENCY_MULTISIG=0x... # Your Emergency Safe address
TREASURY_MULTISIG=0x... # Your Treasury Safe address

# Contract Addresses (after deployment)
NEXUS_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x...
POT_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x...
DEFAI_MANAGER_ADDRESS=0x...

# Network Configuration
MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY
PRIVATE_KEY=your_deployer_private_key
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
```

#### 2.2 Deploy Contracts with Multi-sig Configuration

```bash
# Deploy contracts to mainnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-mainnet.js --network mainnet

# Setup multi-signature roles
npx hardhat run scripts/setup-multisig.js --network mainnet
```

### Step 3: Role Assignment Verification
