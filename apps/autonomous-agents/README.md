# Autonomous CeDeFi Agents

## Summary
This module provides multi-agent systems for portfolio, trade, compliance, and yield management, with voice overrides and reinforcement learning.

## Technical Notes
- LangChain for agent orchestration
- RL algorithms for learning loop
- Voice command integration
- Real-time strategy execution

## TODOs
- [ ] Scaffold multi-agent system
- [ ] Integrate RL learning loop
- [ ] Implement voice override system
- [ ] Add real-time execution engine
